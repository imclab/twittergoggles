1. Rebase your project
2. Dataviz - Style the reporting page
3. Use the index.html and /group6_dataviz/dataViz/attempt2.php as examples of correct menu links
4. Dataviz - adjust bar graph to account for the new size of data (larger counts)
5. Persistence - note the summary table:
	
	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `tweet_count`;
	create table tweet_count
	as
	select count(*) as last_count, a.query, b.job_id
	from job a, tweet b
	where a.job_id = b.job_id
	group by a.query, b.job_id
	order by last_count desc;

6. Everyone - Note the use of DB connect strings in db_connect_info.txt and how it is used.  Point YOUR pages to this file and eliminate all hard coding of credentials.  Example db_connect_info.txt:

	<?php

	// Data connection information include file


	$dbhost = "sociotechnical.ischool.drexel.edu"; //Database host
	$dbuser = "info154"; //Database username
	$dbpass = "info154"; //Database password
	$dbname = "goggles_test"; //Database schema name

	?>

	example use:

		include('db_connect_info.txt');

		$link= mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass);

		$db_select_result = mysql_select_db($dbname);
		if (!$db_select_result) {
		    die('*** Error: could not select database: ' . mysql_error() . "\n");
		}

7. Job Administration - Push the ability to edit state and head in the job table to Github
